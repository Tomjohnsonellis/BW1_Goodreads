# Strive Build Week 1: Dystopian Analysis

_In this gruelling week, our team of confused, exhausted Strivers trawled through a vast expanse of data, desperately looking for anything that could help them survive in the ever evolving world of data science._
<br>
In this project, we are using [Goodreads' list of Best Dystopian Books](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/47.Best_Dystopian_and_Post_Apocalyptic_Fiction) and the information available about each of them. Our goal is to search for insights into what factors could be important when you want to write a best-selling book.
<br>
We will be presenting our findings to a non-technical audience who will be highly influenced by the style of our presentation.<br>
